# [The Factory Method Pattern] 
defines an interface
for creating an object, but lets subclasses decide which
class to instantiate. Factory Method lets a class defer
instantiation to subclasses.

# [The Abstract Factory Pattern] 
provides an interface
for creating families of related or dependent objects
without specifying their concrete classes.
